                <p>Begin your winter wildlife safari tour with a gourmet coffee, tea or hot chocolate from one of
                    Jackson’s local coffee houses. Then explore the National Elk Refuge, home to thousands of wintering
                    elk, hundreds of bison, bighorn sheep and an array of bird life. You will then head north along the
                    western boundary of the refuge to Grand Teton National Park. You will travel along the southern park
                    roads watching for wildlife and stopping frequently for photo-ops. You will see places like antelope
                    flats, the small town of Kelly and have views of several mountain ranges that form the valley of
                    Jackson Hole. Jackson Hole’s wintering wildlife is abundant with opportunities to see bison, elk,
                    deer, moose, fox, coyote, bald eagle, trumpeter swans, and if we’re lucky, wolves. </p>
